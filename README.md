# New Asgard Chess

A Norse-themed chess game with AI integration using Stockfish.

## Project Structure

This project is a React application (using Next.js) with a chess game that includes AI integration using Stockfish.

### Key Directories:

- `/src/ai` - Chess AI implementation
- `/src/components/Chess` - Chess game components
- `/src/hooks` - React hooks for the game
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions

## Current Task

Implement a cross-platform AI integration for the chess game using Stockfish. The implementation should work on both iOS and Android, with a temporary JavaScript fallback for immediate testing.

See the detailed instructions in the Claude Code Instructions document.
